# The SELinux Toggler (Test 1)

The SelinuxToggler is a Reboot off the Original SELinuxModeChanger by (and with a very special thanks to) MrBIMC .

This is a simple android app that allows the user to manually change a device's default SELinux State to and from Enforcement and Permissive Modes upon demand.

With the Original SELinuxModeChanger being an opensourced project, this Github repository for the The SELinux Toggler  will be opensourced as well.

Please bear with me as I acclimate myself with Github again since it's been a long time since I had actively used it. 

I intend to, eventually, be using Github for this project and have, currently, been updating this project at home.

Please go to the following Official Forum thread for all project releases, news, updates and support (or just to say Hello!).
